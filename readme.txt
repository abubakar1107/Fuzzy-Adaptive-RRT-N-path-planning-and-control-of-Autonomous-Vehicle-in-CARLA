Got it! If you want to upload the actual project files (not zipped), while avoiding setting up Git locally for each project, here's a simpler method using GitHub's web interface directly without the need to zip:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Upload Projects without Zipping:

#### 1. **Create a Repository for Each Project on GitHub**
   - Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in.
   - In the top-right corner, click the **+** icon and choose **New repository**.
   - Name the repository according to the project and add a short description if you'd like.
   - Choose **Public** so others can see it (if you want to showcase your work), and click **Create repository**.

#### 2. **Upload Project Files Directly to GitHub**
   - After creating the repository, youâ€™ll be taken to an empty repository page.
   - Click the **Add file** button, then select **Upload files**.
   - Drag and drop your **entire project folder** (not zipped) or navigate to it via the file explorer.
   - GitHub will upload all the files and folders within that project.
   - After the upload completes, scroll down and click **Commit changes** to save everything.

#### 3. **Repeat for Each Project**
   - Repeat this process for each project, creating a new repository for each one and uploading the project files directly through GitHub's interface.

### Optional: Add a README for Each Project
For a better presentation, you can create a `README.md` file for each repository. This can be done either while uploading your files or after. The README file should contain a brief description of your project, technologies used, and any other relevant information.
