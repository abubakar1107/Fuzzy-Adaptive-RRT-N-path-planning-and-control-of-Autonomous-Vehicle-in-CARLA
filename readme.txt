To run the FA-RRT*N algorithm, run the python file named "FA-RRT_star_N.py" in a code editor of your choice.
    -python FA-RRT_star_N.py

To run the RRT* algorithm, run the python file named "RRT_star.py" in a code editor of your choice.
    -python RRT_star.py


System details for simulation:

Min 8 gb ram and a 4 gb graphics card is required and a minimum storage of 60 gb is required 

To visualize the simulation:

1. Install CARLA simulator in your device.
2. Go to the file "CarlaUE4.exe" and run it or start it. this is typically located at  "<path_to_carla_instalation>\CARLA_Latest\WindowsNoEditor\".
3. Open powerpoint shell as administrator and run the script "FA-RRT_star_N_CARLA.py" | -python run FA-RRT_star_N_CARLA.py
4. Make sure you wait before running the script untill the carla server is fully initialized. (This may take some time).

This will open a pygame window and the simulation can be visualized in the simulator
